⋅⋅* The bulk of the computation takes place in Dfa.java.
⋅⋅* Dfa.java has multiple methods, all of which are commented for code readability.
⋅⋅* The main method holds a Dfa object, which will have one method called on it, construct()
⋅⋅* construct() is a method in Dfa.java that holds all other necessary functions
